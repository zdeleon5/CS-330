# CS-330

When designing this project I chose to use a test-driven apporach. This meant testing all changes before implementing them into the program fully. This allwoed me to make better decisionss and streamline the development process. Iteration factored in heavily into this project. It was important to get both positioning and scale correct, so the decisions for these were made iteratively, as they needed to be precise. Computer science is helping me reach my goals by improving my problem-solving skills.
